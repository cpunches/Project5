## Exploring PISA 2012 data 
## by Corey Punches


## Dataset

The dataset used was the PISA data from a 2012 study on students from 65 economies around the world. Student scores in math, reading, and science were captured as well as a multitude of answers about the students perception of their ability, anxiety they feel, etc.

There are 485,490 rows of student data with which originally had 636 columns. Through cleaning I pared the data down to the 10 columns of interest. There are 7 columns of qualitative categorical data which have been made into ordered factor variables of multiple levels.


## Summary of Findings

There does appear to be a correlation between student feelings of anxiety and their test score acheivement.


## Key Insights for Presentation

Those feeling less anxiety have higher test scores, males feel slightly less anxiety and score slightly higher than females.
